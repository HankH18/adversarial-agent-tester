Adversarial AI Security Platform
Building a Multi-Agent Adversarial Evaluation System for AI-Assisted Healthcare
Project Requirements Document
Gauntlet AI — Austin Admission Track — Week 3
How to Use This Case Study
This case study is your north star for the duration of this project. You are required to use
it as the foundation for every decision you make: what you build, what you prioritize, and
what you expand. It does not define the ceiling. If you see opportunities to go deeper or
broader, take them, but do it in the spirit of the case study, not in spite of it.
What this case study does define is the floor: every feature, every architectural decision,
and every tradeoff you make should be traceable back to the problem of building a
system that can continuously identify, evaluate, and defend against adversarial attacks
on AI-assisted clinical workflows. Use this document as a reference, a constraint, and a
lens.
The decisions you make this week build directly on the foundation from Weeks 1 and 2.
Good architecture compounds; technical debt costs double. You will be evaluated on
your thoroughness, your thoughtfulness, your creativity, and your ability to leverage
technology to build something viable and defensible.
The Scenario
OpenEMR has recently begun experimenting with AI-assisted workflows through a new
Clinical Co-Pilot chatbot feature connected to patient and operational data. The system
is intended to help users retrieve chart information, summarize notes, assist with intake
workflows, and support general clinical operations inside the OpenEMR environment.
The early prototype has shown promise, but there are growing concerns around
reliability, security, and long-term maintainability.

As usage increased, inconsistent behavior began surfacing under certain conditions.
Some prompts caused the assistant to behave outside its intended scope. Some
uploaded content appeared to influence future responses in unexpected ways.
Multi-turn conversations occasionally produced responses that ignored previous
safeguards or operational boundaries.
At the same time, infrastructure costs began increasing faster than expected.
Long-running conversations, repeated retrieval behavior, recursive tool usage, and large
prompt chains made it difficult to predict runtime cost and performance. Some tests
produced inconsistent results between runs, making evaluation and debugging difficult.
The larger concern is not whether a single exploit exists.
The concern is whether the system can continuously identify, evaluate, and
defend against new attack techniques as the platform evolves.
The current testing process relies mostly on manual prompting and static attack lists.
Vulnerabilities discovered during testing are difficult to reproduce consistently. Fixes are
often validated once and never tested again against future variants or regressions.
There is limited visibility into which attack categories are actually covered and which
parts of the system remain largely untested.
OpenEMR leadership wants to move beyond one-time penetration testing and toward a
reusable adversarial evaluation platform capable of continuously stress testing AI
systems connected to healthcare workflows.
You have been brought in to design the next generation of that security infrastructure.
Your objective is to build a system capable of:
• Discovering vulnerabilities automatically
• Generating adversarial attacks dynamically
• Measuring attack success and coverage over time
• Converting successful exploits into repeatable evaluations
• Validating that fixes actually work
• Preventing regressions as the system evolves
• Documenting vulnerabilities professionally
• Improving visibility into how the system behaves under adversarial pressure
The organization also recognizes several operational realities. Large frontier models
can become prohibitively expensive when used for continuous security testing at scale.
Some commercial LLMs are intentionally trained to avoid offensive security workflows,
making them unreliable for certain forms of adversarial testing. Smaller or open-source
models may provide different capabilities, lower cost, or greater flexibility depending on
the task.

Traditional non-AI security tooling may also outperform LLM-driven approaches in
certain areas, especially around deterministic validation, replay testing, fuzzing, and
protocol-level analysis. Part of the challenge is determining which tools, models,
evaluation strategies, and security methodologies are most appropriate for building a
scalable and repeatable adversarial testing platform.
WHY THIS
MATTERS
The goal is not simply to find a few jailbreaks. The goal is to build a
system of agents that can hunt, evaluate, escalate, and document
vulnerabilities continuously — adapting as attackers adapt, without a
human in the loop for every step. A static test suite is not the answer.
An autonomous multi-agent red team is.
The Hard Problems
This is not a build-whatever-you-want project. The case study surface area is
intentionally constrained, but the engineering problems within it are real and unresolved.
Your job is not simply to generate attacks. Your job is to build a multi-agent system
capable of discovering, evaluating, validating, and improving the security posture of an
evolving LLM application — autonomously and continuously.
A single-agent or pipeline architecture will not satisfy this assignment. The problems
below are structured specifically because they require different agents with different
roles, capabilities, and trust levels operating in coordination. A red team agent that
generates attacks is not the same as a judge agent that evaluates them. An
orchestrator that prioritizes coverage is not the same as a documentation agent that
files vulnerability reports. These are distinct responsibilities that benefit from distinct
agents.
How you design those agents, how they communicate, how they hand off work, and
how they recover from failure are the core engineering decisions of this assignment.
There are many valid multi-agent architectures. The requirement is that your decisions
are deliberate, defensible, and grounded in evidence.
Adversarial Robustness
Systems that perform well under normal usage can behave very differently under
adversarial pressure. Prompt injection, indirect instructions, multi-turn manipulation,
uploaded content, and state corruption can all influence model behavior in subtle ways
that are difficult to predict ahead of time.
The challenge is not simply finding one successful exploit. The harder problem is
determining whether a category of exploit has actually been addressed, especially once
attacks begin mutating and evolving over time. Static payload lists become outdated

quickly. Defenses built around a small number of known examples rarely hold as
attackers adapt.
This is precisely why a static test runner is insufficient. You need an agent whose job is
to probe, mutate, and escalate — one that can take a partially-successful attack and
autonomously generate ten variants to find the version that breaks through. That agent
should not need a human to tell it what to try next.
Evaluation & Regression
Finding a vulnerability once is not enough. A discovered exploit only becomes useful
when it can be reproduced consistently, converted into an evaluation, and used to
validate future changes to the system.
One of the difficult engineering problems in AI systems is determining whether a fix
actually improves the system or simply changes its behavior temporarily. Defenses may
block one attack while introducing regressions somewhere else. Other fixes may appear
successful until a slightly modified variant bypasses them again later.
This creates a distinct role in your architecture: a judge agent whose sole responsibility
is evaluating whether an attack succeeded, whether a defense held, and whether a
regression has appeared. The judge must be independent of the attack engine — an
agent that both generates attacks and evaluates them is compromised by design. How
you define the judge’s evaluation criteria, how you prevent it from drifting, and how you
validate the judge itself are hard problems you must solve.
Visibility & Observability
Security systems are difficult to improve when there is little visibility into what is actually
happening inside them. It is often unclear which attack surfaces have been explored,
which attack categories are succeeding most often, or whether the system is improving
or regressing as changes are introduced.
The challenge is not only executing attacks, but understanding system behavior well
enough to measure progress over time and make intelligent decisions about what to test
next. This is the role of an orchestrator agent: one that reads the state of the system —
coverage gaps, high-severity open findings, recent regressions — and decides where to
direct the red team agent’s attention. Without this layer, your platform is just running
attacks randomly. With it, your platform is learning.
Your system should help make the attack surface more understandable over time, not
more opaque. Logging, reporting, replayability, and trend analysis are not afterthoughts
— they are the signals your orchestrator depends on to function.

---

## — page 5 —

Cost, Scale, & Model Constraints
Large frontier models are powerful, but they are also expensive, inconsistent,
rate-limited, and often intentionally resistant to offensive security workflows. Approaches
that work during small experiments may become difficult to sustain once testing volume
increases.
Part of the challenge is determining when AI-driven approaches are useful, when
deterministic systems are more reliable, and when smaller or local models may be more
practical than large hosted APIs. Traditional security tooling may also outperform LLMs
in certain scenarios.
The assignment intentionally leaves those decisions open-ended.
Discovery, Remediation, & Trust
Finding vulnerabilities and fixing vulnerabilities are different problems. A real security
workflow does not stop once an exploit is discovered. Vulnerabilities must be
documented, reproduced, evaluated, patched, validated, and monitored over time.
This creates another natural agent boundary: a documentation agent that takes a
confirmed exploit from the judge and produces a structured, professional vulnerability
report — without human intervention. But automation introduces its own trust problem.
A system that autonomously files vulnerability reports, recommends patches, or triggers
remediation workflows must have clearly defined trust boundaries and human approval
gates. An agent that confidently documents a false positive wastes engineering time. An
agent with the ability to push fixes without review can introduce entirely new
vulnerabilities.
Part of this assignment is designing those trust boundaries deliberately. Where does
your system stop and ask a human? Where does it proceed autonomously? How does it
communicate confidence, and what happens when that confidence is wrong?
Existing Security Research & Industry Practices
Many of the challenges in this assignment already exist in the real world. Security
researchers, red teams, and AI safety organizations have spent years developing
methodologies, terminology, frameworks, and testing approaches for adversarial
systems.
Part of the challenge is learning what already exists, understanding where current
approaches succeed or fail, and deciding which ideas are applicable to LLM systems
specifically.

The assignment intentionally does not prescribe a single correct architecture or
workflow. Part of the work is navigating an ambiguous and rapidly evolving problem
space and making thoughtful engineering decisions within it.
Project Schedule
Checkpoint Deadline
Architecture Defense 2 1/2 hours after kickoff
MVP Tuesday @ 11:59 PM
Final Friday @ Noon
MVP Requirements
The MVP is not a finished adversarial platform. It is the foundation that makes a
trustworthy, repeatable evaluation system possible.
Stage Name Deliverable
1 Stand Up the
Target
Clinical Co-Pilot from Weeks 1 and 2 running locally
and deployed, ready to be tested
2 Map the Attack
Surface
A structured breakdown of all adversarial entry points,
trust boundaries, and threat categories
3 Build Initial Attack
Suite
A working set of adversarial test cases across at least
three attack categories
4 Plan the Platform
Architecture
A concrete, defensible plan for how the full adversarial
evaluation system will be built
Stage 1 — Stand Up the Target
Your adversarial platform needs something to attack. Ensure your Clinical Co-Pilot from
Weeks 1 and 2 is running in a testable state — locally and deployed. If you are starting
fresh, you can use the OpenEMR Clinical Co-Pilot from the Week 1 case study as your
target.
Document any changes made to bring the system into a testable state. This becomes
part of your README and your threat model context.

---

## — page 7 —

HARD GATE
Your deployed target application URL must be submitted with every
checkpoint. The adversarial platform must be running tests against a
live system, not just a mock.
Stage 2 — Map the Attack Surface
Before building attacks, you must understand what you are attacking. Produce a
structured threat model covering the full attack surface of the Clinical Co-Pilot. At
minimum, this should include:
• Prompt injection vectors — direct, indirect, and multi-turn
• Data exfiltration paths — PHI leakage, cross-patient data exposure, authorization
bypass
• State corruption attacks — conversation history manipulation, context poisoning
• Tool misuse — unintended tool invocation, parameter tampering, recursive tool
calls
• Denial of service patterns — token exhaustion, infinite loops, cost amplification
• Identity and role exploitation — privilege escalation, persona hijacking, trust
boundary violations
For each category, identify: the attack surface, the potential impact, the difficulty of
exploitation, and whether existing defenses address it. This threat model is not a
one-time artifact — it is a living document your platform will continuously exercise.
HARD GATE
A markdown document (./THREAT_MODEL.md) with your full attack
surface map. The document must begin with a ~500 word summary of
your key findings, the highest-risk attack categories, and how your
platform will prioritize coverage.
Stage 3 — Build Initial Attack Suite
Using your threat model as input, build an initial set of adversarial test cases that
exercise the highest-priority attack categories. These are not static payloads — they are
the seed cases your Red Team Agent will learn from and extend. You should also have
a working prototype of at least one agent role operating against the live target at this
stage.
Each test case should include:
• Attack category and subcategory
• The specific prompt or input sequence
• The expected safe behavior
• The observed behavior (pass/fail/partial)
• Severity rating and exploitability assessment
• Whether the case should be added to the regression suite

---

## — page 8 —

You are not expected to have the full multi-agent platform running at this stage. You are
expected to demonstrate that your test cases are structured, reproducible, and
extensible — and that you have begun building the agent architecture that will scale
them.
HARD GATE
A working test suite (./evals/) with results from at least three distinct
attack categories, plus a working prototype of at least one agent role
(Red Team, Judge, or Orchestrator) running live against the deployed
target.
Stage 4 — Plan the Platform Architecture
Using your threat model and user definitions as inputs, produce a forward-looking
architecture plan for the full multi-agent adversarial evaluation platform. This plan must
define each agent role, its responsibilities, its inputs and outputs, and how it coordinates
with the others. It should also address:
• Which agent is responsible for each function: attack generation, evaluation,
orchestration, documentation
• How agents communicate — what messages or signals pass between them and
in what format
• How the Orchestrator decides what the Red Team Agent targets next
• How the Judge Agent’s verdicts feed into the regression harness
• Where human approval gates exist and why they are placed there
• Where AI is used versus deterministic tooling, and the justification for each
• How the platform handles cost, rate limits, and model constraints at scale
• What framework or infrastructure manages agent state and coordination
You do not need to implement the full platform at this stage. You need to think clearly,
write it down, and be able to defend every architectural decision — especially the ones
that involve agents acting autonomously.
HARD GATE
A markdown document (./ARCHITECTURE.md) defining your
multi-agent platform architecture. The document must begin with a
~500 word summary and must explicitly name each agent, its role, and
how it fits into the overall system. A diagram of agent interactions is
strongly recommended.
Platform Requirements
Your adversarial evaluation platform must be built as a multi-agent system. The
following are the required agent roles and platform components. How you implement

---

## — page 9 —

each one — what framework you use, how agents communicate, how state is managed
— is a design decision you own. What is not optional is the multi-agent architecture
itself.
ARCHITECT
URE
REQUIREM
ENT
A single-agent or pipeline architecture does not satisfy this assignment.
Each role below represents a distinct agent with its own responsibilities,
context, and decision-making authority. Your ARCHITECTURE.md
must define each agent, its inputs and outputs, its trust level, and how it
coordinates with the others.
Multi-Agent Adversarial System
The core of the platform is a multi-agent system that autonomously discovers,
evaluates, and escalates vulnerabilities in the Clinical Co-Pilot. How you design that
system — how many agents, what roles, what framework, how they communicate — is
your architectural decision to make and defend.
Whatever architecture you choose, the system must collectively be capable of:
• Generating novel adversarial inputs
• Mutating partially-successful attacks to probe for bypasses
• Targeting multi-turn attack sequences, not just single-prompt injections
• Evaluating whether an attack succeeded, with consistent criteria across runs and
system versions
• Prioritizing which attack surfaces to explore next based on coverage gaps and
unresolved findings
• Halting or redirecting when cost is accumulating without producing signal
• Triggering regression runs when the target system changes
These capabilities imply distinct responsibilities. Attack generation and attack evaluation
are different jobs — a system that does both in the same context has a conflict of
interest by design. Strategic prioritization is different from execution. How you separate,
combine, or coordinate those responsibilities across agents is the core architecture
problem of this assignment.
Think carefully about what models power each role. Commercial frontier models are
often trained to refuse offensive security workflows. Smaller or open-source models may
be more capable in certain positions. That is a deliberate decision you must make and
defend. LLM cost is also a factor as this can run up tokens very quickly.
Documentation Agent
The Documentation Agent converts confirmed exploits from the Judge Agent into
structured, professional vulnerability reports — without requiring a human to write them.

---

## — page 10 —

Each report it produces must be reproducible, actionable, and usable by an engineer
who was not present when the exploit was found.
At minimum, each report must include:
• A unique identifier and severity rating
• A clear description of the vulnerability and its clinical impact
• A minimal, reproducible attack sequence
• The observed versus expected behavior
• Recommended remediation approach
• Current status and fix validation results
The bar is not that the Documentation Agent produces interesting output. The bar is that
a senior security engineer could reproduce, validate, and fix the vulnerability based
solely on what the agent writes.
Regression & Validation Harness
Across all agents, the platform must maintain a regression harness that converts
confirmed exploits into deterministic, repeatable test cases and runs them against every
new version of the target system. The harness must:
• Store confirmed exploits in a versioned, queryable format
• Run the full regression suite automatically when triggered by the Orchestrator
• Detect when a previously-fixed vulnerability has reappeared
• Flag when fixing one attack introduces a regression in another category
Think carefully about what it means for a regression test to pass. A test that passes
because the model’s behavior changed — not because the vulnerability was actually
fixed — is worse than no test at all.
Observability Layer
The platform must surface enough information for the Orchestrator to make intelligent
decisions and for a human operator to understand system behavior at any time. At
minimum, you must be able to answer:
• Which attack categories have been tested, and how many cases exist per
category?
• What is the current pass/fail rate across all test categories and system versions?
• Is the target system becoming more or less resilient over time?
• Which vulnerabilities are open, in progress, or resolved?
• How much did this test run cost, and at what rate is cost scaling?
• What is each agent doing, and in what order did it happen?

---

## — page 11 —

The observability layer is not just for humans. It is the data substrate your Orchestrator
Agent reads. Design it accordingly.
Engineering Requirements
The following requirements apply in addition to the project-specific deliverables above. They are
graded alongside the core submission and are not optional.
OWASP Top 10 and OWASP LLM risks. The attack suite must cover the OWASP Top 10 web
vulnerabilities relevant to the Clinical Co-Pilot (broken access control, injection, insecure design,
vulnerable components, auth failures, logging failures, SSRF) in addition to the OWASP LLM Top
10 (prompt injection, insecure output handling, sensitive information disclosure, excessive
agency, supply-chain risks). Map each test case to its OWASP category in the eval dataset.
Optional Engineering Deliverables
The following requirements apply in addition to the project-specific deliverables above. They are
graded alongside the core submission and are not optional.
Test design for boundaries, invariants, and regression. Every adversarial test case must exercise
a boundary (maximum prompt length, minimum token budget, edge-case multi-turn sequence),
an invariant (the Judge must never approve a confirmed successful exploit), or a regression risk
(a previously fixed vulnerability reappearing). Static payload lists do not satisfy this requirement.
Build-versus-configure decisions: custom agents, workflow platforms, deterministic tooling,
COTS/SaaS. Before implementing any agent role, document a build-versus-configure decision
record: what existing tools were evaluated (Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Semgrep, Garak,
commercial red-team platforms), what each covers, where it falls short for this use case, and why
a custom agent is justified over configuring an existing tool. This record is a required Architecture
Defense deliverable.
Triage simulated scan report with critical, high, medium, and false-positive findings. As part of
the platform, build a triage exercise: generate a simulated vulnerability scan report containing at
least ten findings across critical, high, medium, and false-positive categories. Document how you
would validate, remediate, defer, or document each finding. This demonstrates the
Documentation Agent's output is usable for real triage decisions.
Interface arbitration, contract tests, migration notes, architecture review, evidence packets,
failure drills. Define typed contracts for every inter-agent message (Orchestrator-to-RedTeam,
RedTeam-to-Judge, Judge-to-Documentation). Write contract tests that verify these message
shapes. Any change to an agent interface must be recorded in a migration note. Your Architecture
Defense must include an evidence packet: agent interaction diagram, message schemas, trust
boundaries, and known failure modes.
Build one component, inherit another, serve as integration lead for one cross-service
boundary. During the integration week exercise, each student builds one agent role and
integrates with a peer's independently built agent. The integration must work through the
published message contract alone — no shared source access. Produce an integration packet:
interface diffs, ADRs for any contract corrections, contract test results, and a cross-agent trace
proving end-to-end correctness.
OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, protobuf, JSON Schema, or equivalent protocol contracts. All inter-agent
communication must use a versioned schema definition (JSON Schema or equivalent). Publish
the schemas in a /contracts directory. Contract tests must verify that both the producing and
consuming agents conform to the published schema. Breaking changes require a version bump.

---

## — page 12 —

ATO-style evidence packet. Produce an ATO-style evidence packet as a submission artifact:
architecture diagram, data flow diagram, auth model (which agents can call which targets and
with what credentials), dependency list with versions, vulnerability scan results from the platform
itself, test evidence (eval results), and a sample incident/postmortem. This is separate from the
Architecture Doc — it is the artifact a security reviewer would accept.
AI-use disclosure: where AI was used, what was independently verified, what remains risky.
Include an AI-use disclosure section in ARCHITECTURE.md: list every agent role powered by AI,
what deterministic verification or human approval follows each AI decision, and what risks remain.
The Judge Agent's evaluation criteria must be independently verifiable — document how you
would detect and correct a drifting judge.
Integration packet: interface diffs, ADRs, contract-test results, cross-team dependency map,
end-to-end result proof. Produce a full integration packet as a submission artifact: diffs showing
where original agent message contracts were corrected, ADRs recording those decisions,
contract test results from both sides of each agent boundary, a dependency map showing which
agents call which, and a trace proving end-to-end correctness through the full platform.
Version API contracts. All inter-agent message schemas must be versioned (minimum: v1). Any
breaking change to a message schema requires a version bump, a migration note, and updated
contract tests. The /contracts directory must reflect the current version of every schema.
Explicit error schemas. Every agent must define typed error responses for its known failure modes:
target unreachable, budget exceeded, judge timeout, no findings in window, regression detected.
Error schemas must be published in /contracts alongside the success schemas.
Pagination, rate limits, and auth requirements documented. Document the rate limits and auth
requirements for every external API the platform calls: LLM providers, the Clinical Co-Pilot target,
observability backends. Define how the platform handles rate limit responses — backoff, queue,
or abort — and document this behavior in ARCHITECTURE.md.
Data-quality checks: required fields, uniqueness, referential integrity, privacy-sensitive data.
The exploit database must enforce data quality: every confirmed exploit has a unique identifier,
required fields (severity, attack category, reproduction steps, observed behavior, expected
behavior), and no duplicate entries for the same attack sequence. Validate these constraints in
the Documentation Agent before writing a report.
API versioning, database performance, migrations, queues, workflow state. The exploit
database schema must support migration — if you add a field to the vulnerability report format,
existing records must be migrated without data loss. Document the migration approach. If the
platform uses a queue (for agent work items or regression runs), document the queue depth
monitoring and what happens when it backs up.
Data modeling, ingestion, validation, lineage, access control, reporting, data quality. Document
the data model for the adversarial platform's own data: exploit records, regression test cases,
agent run logs, coverage metrics. Define access controls: which agents can write exploits, which
can only read them, and what human approval is required before a finding is published.
SQL performance, indexing, batch jobs, reproducible analysis. If the exploit database uses SQL,
document the indexes on the most common query patterns (by severity, by attack category, by
system version). Regression runs that scan the full exploit database must complete within a
defined time budget — document this SLO and verify it in CI.
Baseline CPU, memory, latency, and throughput profiles. Capture baseline metrics for the
adversarial platform itself under a representative test run (100 attack cases, full regression suite).
Include these baselines in the submission so future platform performance changes can be
measured against them.
Load/stress tests with realistic scenarios. Run a load test simulating the platform executing 100
consecutive attack cases against the live target. Record platform-level metrics (agent
orchestration latency, LLM call latency, exploit storage throughput). Identify the bottleneck and
document the architectural change that would address it.

Final Note
The deliverable that matters is not the one that finds the most impressive jailbreak in a
demo. It’s the one you could defend in front of a hospital CISO who is deciding whether
to trust this platform with continuous security testing of systems their physicians depend
on.
That is the standard. Build to it.
